LLM Observing Users:

The primary purpose of this script is to interact with users via a command-line interface, leveraging the OpenAI API to generate responses to user inputs. It further analyzes these interactions by sending the user inputs to the API with a specific instruction to make observations about the user. These observations are then stored in a text file. Essentially, it serves as a tool for real-time chat with AI, coupled with an analysis and logging mechanism for studying user interactions.
