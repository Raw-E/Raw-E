Enhancements to Consider:
    Multi-dimensional Rating System: Instead of a single numeric rating, consider allowing users to rate multiple aspects of their well-being, such as energy level, mood, digestive comfort, etc., on the 0-10 scale. This could provide more nuanced insights into how different recipes affect various aspects of health and well-being.
    Sentiment Analysis on Verbal Expressions: Implement natural language processing (NLP) to perform sentiment analysis on the verbal expressions. This can help in automatically categorizing feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments, and even identifying recurring themes (like specific symptoms or feelings).
    Tags or Categories for Verbal Expressions: Allow users to add tags (e.g., #Headache, #Energetic, #Sleepy) to their verbal expressions to standardize the data somewhat and make it easier to analyze trends over time.
    Follow-up Questions Based on Input: If a user inputs a particularly low or high rating, you could prompt with follow-up questions to gather more specific information about their experience. This can help in understanding the context behind extreme ratings.
    Integration with Physical Activity and Sleep Data: If users are willing to provide information on physical activity and sleep, you could correlate these factors with their state of being. This would offer a more holistic view of how lifestyle factors interact with diet.
    Privacy and Data Protection: Make sure to implement robust data protection measures, especially since you're dealing with sensitive personal health information. Ensure users are informed about how their data will be used and stored.
    Add way to track specific factor (like meal or activity) that may have affected the state of being
